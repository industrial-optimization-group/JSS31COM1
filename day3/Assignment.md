# Day 3 assignments

## Assignment 1: The payoff-table method

Start by defining a multiobjective optimization problem as an instance of the `MOProblem` class.
You can use a problem you have defined previously, some of the test problems available, or
you can come up with your own problem.

Once you have defined your problem, use the payoff-table method defined in `desdeo-tools` to
compute the ideal, and approximate the nadir point, of the problem you have defined.

Report the value of the ideal point and nadir points (in the objective space). Give also a couple of
comments on the quality of the points. Do they make sense?

## Assignment 2: Scalarizing functions

Different scalarizing functions will produce different solutions with the same preference information.
Use different scalarizing functions to compute different solutions with the same preference information.

Report on your results and comment on the solutios you have got.

## Assignment 3: Using interactive methods

Solve a previusly defined multiobjective optimization problem utilizing an
interactive method of your choice defined in `desdeo-mcdm`. Some interactive
methods will require a representation of the Pareto optimal front, you can
ignore these methods in your choice.

Report which methods you used, what solution(s) you got, and your thoughs on the method.
