    "interactive method of your choice defined in `desdeo-mcdm`. Some interactive\n",

    "## Hints\n",
    "- Using the interactive methods found in the `desdeo_mcdm.interactive` module follows a standard pattern:\n",
    "    1. The method is first initialized by instantiating an instance of the method's class.\n",
    "    2. Then, the `start`-method of the class' instance is called. This will return the first _request_ object.\n",
    "    3. The request object has both a `content` and `response` dictionary as an attribute. \n",
    "    4. The `contents` dictionary has an entry `message` that will contain instructions on how to proceed.\n",
    "    5. According to the instructions, new dictionary entries should be added to the `response` dictionary in the original _request_ object.\n",
    "    6. Finally, the `iterate` method of the interactive method should be called with the _request_ object as the only argument (with the `response` dictionary filled with relevant entries).\n",
    "    7. The `iterate` method will return a new _request_ object. This process is continued from step 3 and iterated until a satisfying solution is reached.\n",
    "- This above process is described in more detail in the DESDEO article, Section III-B, found [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9591595).\n",
    "- The above article contains other examples in Section IV that can be useful when tackling this assignment.\n",
    "- Some interactive methods will require a representation of the Pareto optimal front to function. You do not need to use these methods. Methods you can use are: NIMBUS, NAUTILUS, NAUTILUS2, the Reference Point Method, and Pareto Navigator.\n",
    "- __NOTE__: some interactive methods, like NIMBUS, can return two responses when their `iterate` method is called. Only the first response is relevant in these cases and the second response can be ignored."
